# Get-Next-Line

Usage:
1. Add #include "get_next_line.h" to your .c -file
2. Call function get_next_line in your .c -file to get the next line of a file. 

The function's prototype is _int	get_next_line(const int fd, char **line)_, 
where fd is a file descriptor of the file you want to read and line is a pointer to a string 
where you want the read line to be stored.

Have fun!
