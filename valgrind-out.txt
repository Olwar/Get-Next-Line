==844== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==844== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,
==844== or are doing some strange experiment):
==844==   /Users/oairola/.brew/Cellar/valgrind/HEAD-da51a73/libexec/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=844 ...command...
==844== 
==844== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==844==   /path/to/gdb ./test_gnl
==844== and then give GDB the following command
==844==   target remote | /Users/oairola/.brew/Cellar/valgrind/HEAD-da51a73/libexec/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=844
==844== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running
